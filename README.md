# Comparing Classic to State-of-the-art Image Features

This github repository is the code for the conference paper [Comparing Classic to State-of-the-Art Image Features: A Clustering Approach
Using Local Binary Patterns and ResNet-18 Features for Lung Ultrasound Video Classification](https://siim.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Comparing-Classic-to-State-of-the-Art-Image-Features_Bhattacharjee.pdf)

## Overview

This work investigates the use of Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features and features computed by a ResNet-18 model in an unsupervised learning context to classify LUS video frames in an efficient way. 

The dataset used for this project is from the paper: [Curated and Annotated Dataset of Lung US Images in Zambian Children with Clinical Pneumonia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38381039/)
